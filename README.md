# Usage
## Installing MLIR
In this assignment and your final project you will be working with MLIR and LLVM.
Due to the complex nature (and size) of the project we did not want to include
MLIR as a subproject. Therefore, there is some additional setup required to get your
build up and running.

### On a personal machine
  1. Follow the instructions on the
     [setup page](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~c415/setup/) for your
     machine.

### On university machines
You won't be building MLIR on the university machines: AICT wouldn't be very
happy with you. Instead, we are providing a **RELEASE** build available for
everyone.
  1. Follow the instructions on the
     [setup page](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~c415/setup/) for the CS
     computers and MLIR/LLVM will be available to you.

## Building
### Linux
  1. Install git, java (only the runtime is necessary), and cmake (>= v3.0).
     - Until now, cmake has found the dependencies without issues. If you
       encounter an issue, let a TA know and we can fix it.
  1. Make a directory that you intend to build the project in and change into
     that directory.
  1. Run `cmake <path-to-VCalc-Base>`.
  1. Run `make`.
  1. Done.

## Pulling in upstream changes
If there are updates to your assignment you can retrieve them using the
instructions here.
  1. Add the upstream as a remote using `git remote add upstream <clone-link>`.
  1. Fetch updates from the upstream using `git fetch upstream`
  1. Merge the updates into a local branch using
     `git merge <local branch> upstream/<upstream branch>`. Usually both
     branches are `master`.
  1. Make sure that everything builds before committing to your personal
     master! It's much easier to try again if you can make a fresh clone
     without the merge!

Once the remote has been added, future updates are simply the `fetch` and
`merge` steps.
